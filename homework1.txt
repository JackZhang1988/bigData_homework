1、查询"01"课程比"02"课程成绩高的学生的信息及课程分数

select stu.*, s01.s_score as score_01, s02.s_score as score_02
from student stu,
(select s_id, c_id, s_score from score where c_id=01) s01,
(select s_id, c_id, s_score from score where c_id=02) s02
where s01.s_id = s02.s_id and s01.s_score > s02.s_score and stu.s_id = s01.s_id;


2、查询"01"课程比"02"课程成绩低的学生的信息及课程分数

select stu.*, s01.s_score as score_01, s02.s_score as score_02
from student stu,
(select s_id, c_id, s_score from score where c_id=01) s01,
(select s_id, c_id, s_score from score where c_id=02) s02
where s01.s_id = s02.s_id and s01.s_score < s02.s_score and stu.s_id = s01.s_id;

3、查询平均成绩大于等于60分的同学的学生编号和学生姓名和平均成绩

select student.s_id, student.s_name, avg(score.s_score) as avg_score
from student, score
where student.s_id = score.s_id
group by student.s_id, student.s_name
having avg_score >= 60;

4、查询平均成绩小于60分的同学的学生编号和学生姓名和平均成绩(包括有成绩的和无成绩的)

select student.s_id, student.s_name, avg(score.s_score) as avg_score
from student left join score
on student.s_id = score.s_id
group by student.s_id, student.s_name
having avg_score < 60 or avg_score is null;

5、查询所有同学的学生编号、学生姓名、选课总数、所有课程的总成绩

select student.s_id, student.s_name, count(score.c_id) as score_count, sum(score.s_score) as score_sum
from student left join score
on student.s_id = score.s_id
group by student.s_id, student.s_name;

6、查询"李"姓老师的数量

select count(t_name) from teacher where t_name like '李%';

7、查询学过"张三"老师授课的同学的信息

select * from student where s_id in 
(select s_id from score, course, teacher
where t_name = '张三' 
and course.t_id = teacher.t_id 
and score.c_id = course.c_id);

8、查询没学过"张三"老师授课的同学的信息

select * from student where s_id not in 
(select s_id from score, course, teacher
where t_name = '张三' 
and course.t_id = teacher.t_id 
and score.c_id = course.c_id);

9、查询学过编号为"01"并且也学过编号为"02"的课程的同学的信息

select * from student where s_id in 
(select s_id from score, course
where course.c_id = score.c_id and course.c_id in (01, 02));

10、查询学过编号为"01"但是没有学过编号为"02"的课程的同学的信息

select * from student where s_id in 
(select s_id from score where c_id = 01)
and s_id not in (select s_id from score where c_id = 02)

11、查询没有学全所有课程的同学的信息

select * from student where s_id in
(select s_id from score group by s_id having count(c_id) < 4);

12、查询至少有一门课与学号为"01"的同学所学相同的同学的信息

select * from student where s_id in
(select s_id from score where c_id in 
(select c_id from score where s_id = 01) 
and s_id != 01);

13、查询和"01"号的同学学习的课程完全相同的其他同学的信息
select * from student where s_id in 
(
select s_id from score
where c_id in (select c_id from score where s_id = 01) and s_id != 01
having count(c_id) = 3
);

14、查询没学过"张三"老师讲授的任一门课程的学生姓名

select s_name from student where s_id not in 
(select s_id from score, course, teacher 
where teacher.t_name = '张三' 
and course.t_id = teacher.t_id
and course.c_id = score.c_id);

15、查询两门及其以上不及格课程的同学的学号，姓名及其平均成绩

select s_id, s_name, avg(s_score) from student, score
where student.s_id = score.s_id and score.s_score < 60
group by student.s_id
having count(student.s_id) > 2;
